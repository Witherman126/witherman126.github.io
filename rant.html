            <h1>A rant of mine about the current state of the Internet</h1>
            <br>

            <p>
            
            As of writing this (originally the 1st of August 2025, last updated 14rd of August 2025) privacy on the internet is at a huge risk. The reason being current laws in the United Kingdom and that are most likely coming soon to 
            the USA, Australia, Canada and countries that are part of the European Union.<br>
            I myself am a resident of one of the above. 

            </p>

            <h2>The true intention and risks of these laws</h2>

            <p>

            The laws are about implementing verification of age for content on the internet that is meant for adults or can be "potentially harmful to children". The laws are being passed/have been passed as 
            "Kids Online Safety Act" (USA), "Online Safety Act" (UK) and "S-209" (Canada) to name some examples.<br>
            The way it is meant to be executed is via a system that can either estimate a user's age by submitting a face picture or by submitting an image of a government issued ID.<br>
            While the cause may seem noble at first glance, this is merely a cover to the true intention that is de-anonymising the Internet as a whole. Not only that - this is a security risk, as companies tasked with implementing 
            verification cannot be trusted - one of them has already suffered a data breach. I am not naming which one as to not shame them - this is just a proof of concept that it is a risk.<br>
            Crushing privacy on the internet is also not the only goal - a UK politician has blatantly stated that monitoring and censoring adult individuals on the internet is one of the prime objectives of the Online Safety Act.<br>
            So don't let anyone fool You - this IS about silencing Your free speech and mass surveillance of Internet Users.
            
            </p>

            <h2>How this probably affects You right now</h2>

            <p>

            <ol>
                <li>If You use Twitter/X You may have stumbled upon a post being blocked, with the message "Due to local laws, we are temporarily restricting access to this content until X estimates Your age." 
                This has also been reported to happen to users situated outside of the US, EU member countries, UK, Canada or Australia.</li><br>
                <li>Youtube is currently in the process of implementing verification for users using AI. Not to shame AI, but it has been proven to judge age wrong by examples below.
                <br>Update: they have done it, and as I have predicted, it is wildly innacurate.</li><br>
                <li>Discord has an age verification system for accessing NSFW channels, which can use Your face to judge Your age. There has already been a case where a user's account has been outright suspended 
                and Discord support being unresponsive, because the AI has deemed the user to be under 13 years old (which violates Discord's TOS). To my knowledge the user was a young adult.</li><br>
                <li>A situation similar to Discord's has also happened on Tiktok. The user that submitted their face photo was in his 20's and got flagged as under 13 - as with Discord, the account got suspended.</li><br>
                <li>Spotify has also been hit by the age verification requirement. It has been reported that accounts that refuse are limited or suspended.</li>
                <li>There have been reports of Nvidia app being affected by this, which is just nonsensical. <b>I am yet to verify if this is true.</b></li>
                <li>Wikipedia has lost the court dispute challenging the Online Safety Act. They may be forced to pull out of the UK, limit the access to content or censor themselves. <b>This has basically proven, that the UK government 
                has censorship in mind.</b></li>
            </ol>

            </p>

            <p>

            If You use/used a VPN to circumvent these, please consider the fact that governments may consider a personal use VPN ban. Fun fact: this is nearly impossible to pull off consistently and to have it actually stop people. 
            An example being Chinese and Russian citizens still using the open Internet even though they faced a heavy VPN ban.

            </p>

            <h2>Suspicions and further ramifications</h2>

            <p>

            The whole thing came into force in a relatively short timespan and has been hidden pretty well until now - some may have already seen it coming, but the vast majority of Internet users did not. 
            It has been prtety much proven that this is a coordinated effort proposed by the UN. What has happened as of now is most likely just the beginning of a slippery slope into mass surveillance and a 
            reality akin to Geore Orwell's "1984".<br>
            "Dystopian" would be a good word to describe the governments' actions.<br>
            My idea is this: the governments of the world have realised that the Internet, being a source of near instant information about nearly anything is the biggest thing stopping them from being free to do anything they wish. Possibly 
            stripping us of our own properties and rights, bringing the way we live as of now to the ground and setting up a completely authoritarian government that feeds us lies about itself and everything else, keeping us in a 
            blissfull ignorance powered by deception and hate. Just as in the book "1984" I mentioned above. I encourage You to read it, if You haven't done so yet.

            </p>

            <h2>Things I have noticed</h2>

            <p>

            Current actions to supress out speech and pricacy are very similar to what is currently the case in China, which only proves that this is a substantial risk as the idea is possible to implement. To be precise - in China 
            this censorship has gone so far that citizens willingly self-censor themselves most of the time, the government's actions are completely unaccounted for, be it human rights violations, omitting potential obligations, 
            propaganda in broad daylight and probably many more examples.

            </p>

            <p>

            What is worse, the EU has proposed a "Chat control" idea that scans messages and other content on your device before it is even encrypted - so End-To-End encryption won't even help here. As of writing this only 3 countries 
            have opposed this - The Netherlands, Austria and Poland. More on this on <a href="https://fightchatcontrol.eu/">FightChatControl.eu (url)</a>. The website also offers contact for Your local MEPs if you are a citizen 
            of the EU.

            </p>

            <p>
            
            One really concerning possibility is this: if push comes to shove and we won't be allowed to band together and oppose the government's wrongdoings on the Internet - this will just move out to real life. This could easily lead to protests and civil 
            unrest, possibly taking lives in the process. So this whole fiasco is literally putting lives at risk and not protecting anyone.

            </p>

            <h2>What I ask of You, the reader and some words of closure</h2>

            <p>

            Don't stay silent about it. Talk about it, keep the subject afloat so the idea of our privacy does not become forgotten. Sharing this rant would be a welcome gesture and who knows - it may help in spreading the word.<br>
            If You are able to, I encourage You to do something about it in a proactive fashion - contact Your local 
            representatives (for example, at <a href="https://fightchatcontrol.eu/">FightChatControl.eu</a>) and explain Your concerns about <u>Your right</u> to online privacy and freedom of speech and expression. If there are any petitions against these laws in Your area - sign one. Or two. Or however many You want. The governments need to know, 
            that we are not going to stand for this.<br>
            And that <b>we are not going down without a fight.</b><br>
            <br><br>

            A note, which I could not fit anywhere else as of now: The UK petition against the Online Safety Act has reached over 500 thousand signatures. Despite that fact the UK Government has stated that they will not be 
            repealing the act. Which says only one thing - if we wish to oppose the censorship then we will face heavy resistance, but we can push through.<br>
            Also, this rant really only covers the tip of the iceberg - there is way more to this. I will keep updating this site as things proggress and I learn more.<br><br>
            
            Any statements, quotes, personal experiences regarding the situation, etc. are being kept anonymous until requested by respective individuals. I do not want to create a stir for them - I merely want to state the facts.
