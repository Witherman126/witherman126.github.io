            <h1>A rant of mine about the current state of the Internet</h1>
            <br>

            <p>
            
            As of writing this (1st of August 2025) privacy on the internet is at a huge risk. The reason being current laws in the United Kingdom and that are most likely coming soon to 
            the US, Australia, Canada and countries that are part of the European Union.<br>
            I myself am a resident of one of the above. 

            </p>

            <h2>The true intention and risks of these laws</h2>

            <p>

            The laws are about implementing verification of age for content on the internet that is meant for adults or can be "potentially harmful to children". The laws are being passed/have been passed as 
            "Kids Online Safety Act" (KOSA, in the US), Online Safety Act (UK) to name some examples.<br>
            The way it is meant to be executed is via a system that can either estimate a user's age by submitting a face picture or by submitting a government issued ID.<br>
            While the cause may seem noble at first glance, this is merely a cover to the true intention that is de-anonymising the Internet as a whole. Not only that - this is a security risk, as companies tasked with implementing 
            verification cannot be trusted - one of them has already suffered a data breach. I am not naming which one as to not shame them - this is just a proof of concept that it is a risk.
            
            </p>

            <h2>How this probably affects you right now</h2>

            <p>

            1. If you use Twitter/X you may have stumbled upon a post being blocked, with the message "Due to local laws, we are temporarily restricting access to this content until X estimates your age." 
            This has also been reported to happen to users situated outside of the US, EU member countries, UK, Canada or Australia.<br>
            2. Youtube is currently in the process of implementing verification for users using AI. Not to shame AI, but it has been proven to judge age wrong by an example below.<br>
            3. Discord has an age verification system for accessing NSFW channels, which can use your face to judge your age. There has already been a case where a user's account has been outright suspended 
            and Discord support being unresponsive, because the AI has deemed the user to be under 13 years old (which violates Discord's TOS). To my knowledge the user was a young adult.

            </p>

            <h2>Suspicions and further ramifications</h2>

            <p>

            The whole thing came into force in a very short timespan - some may have already seen it coming, but the vast majority of Internet users did not. Theories about this being a coordinated effort are very popular 
            right now and in my opinion are scary but not implausible. What has happened as of now is most likely just the beginning of a slippery slope into mass surveillance and a reality akin to Geore Orwell's "1984".<br>
            "Dystopian" would be a good word to describe the government's actions.

            </p>

            <h2>What I ask of You, the reader</h2>

            <p>

            Don't stay silent about it. Talk about it, keep the subject afloat so the idea of our privacy does not become forgotten. If You are able to, I encourage You to do something about it in a proactive fashion - contact your local 
            representatives and explain your concerns about <u>your right</u> to online privacy. If there are any petitions against these laws in your area - sign one. Or two. Or however many you want. The governments need to know, 
            that we are not going to stand for this.<br>
            And that <b>we are not going down without a fight.</b>

            </p>
